# EEG-epileptic-seizure

EEG waveform dataset has been taken from University of Bonn, Germany (open souce dataset).
It contains 5 folders A-E where each folder has data of patients in different states and contains waveform of 100 patients.
A –> Non-Epileptic Eyes opened
B -> Non-Epileptic Eyes closed
C -> Epileptic Interictal
D -> Epileptic Interictal
E –> Epileptic Ictal

we have build a convolutional Neural Network to distinguish patients from Epileptic and Non-Epileptic states, Ex: between A/E, B/E, C/E, D/E, (A,B)/E etc.

Model is trained for 100 epochs and performing highly efficiently.
